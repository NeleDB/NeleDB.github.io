As we had it difficult to think of something to create with it, we knew we wanted to move the player to The Upside Down. As we thought further we came with the idea to create a VR experience of it using Three.js and WebVR. We worked 3 weeks on this concept to realise that this wasn't possible with only 2 weeks left. My partner and I went to see the teacher who convinced us to delete this and start all over with a new concept which included Machine Learning. <br/> <br/> Our new concept was that the player has to upload a panorama picture into the website and the website will turn your panorama picture into The Upside Down. Besides that, the player can view this picture in VR so he can look around. So with only two weeks left, we threw ourselfs into the world of Machine Learning and Deep Learning. At first it seemed impossible to make this in only two weeks but we went further and worked everyday from early in the morning till mostly midnight. We had some issues because we had to train our own style, namely The Upside Down style, with a neural network but our laptops' GPU wasn't strong enough. We contacted everyone we knew to find a GPU strong enough to train the style. Eventualy we found someone! The first try didn't work out, as this was only a week before the deadline, we became very stressed. Fortunately, the second time went well. It needed 10 hours to train the style but it was all worth it! <br/> <br/> Eventualy, we reached the deadline with a project were we are very proud of. It was a though project but those are the ones where I'm the proudest of!
